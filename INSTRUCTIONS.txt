APPLICATION INSTRUCTIONS

1. To run The application, use mango.exe in the deployed_app folder

2. The source code can be found in the source_code folder. the file mango.pro is essentially a makefile for the Qt SDK, and mango.pro.user is the projectâ€™s settings for the Qt SDK.

3. You can test the application with any directory of images, but
I recommend using the TEST_MANGA folder that I included, as it
will provide the intended application experience.

4. If you use the TEST_MANGA directory, just know that manga is read from right, not left to right like American comics.

5. The many .dll files are so you can run this application without having to install the Qt SDK (it has been deployed for windows)
